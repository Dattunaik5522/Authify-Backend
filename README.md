# Authify-Backend
Authify Backend
A robust and secure authentication API built on Spring Boot. It's the core of any modern application, providing all the essential user management features you need.

üìù What it Does
This project is a complete backend solution for user authentication. It handles everything from creating new accounts to managing secure sessions, so you don't have to build it from scratch.

‚ú® Core Features
User Registration: A clean signup process that automatically sends a welcome email.

Secure Login: Users log in to receive a JWT (JSON Web Token) for authenticated access.

Email Verification: A confirmation flow that sends a One-Time Password (OTP) to securely activate a user's account.

Password Reset: A secure process using an OTP to verify a user's identity before they can set a new password.

Token-Based Authentication: All protected endpoints require a valid JWT, ensuring your APIs are secure.

User Logout: A simple endpoint to invalidate JWT tokens, providing a reliable logout mechanism.
